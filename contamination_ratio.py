    Parameters
    ----------
    spike_train : list,
        List of timing.
    sampling_rate : int,
        Sampling rate of the recording, if list_sample is is s set to 1.
    total_duration: float,
        Total lenght of the recording, same unit as spike_train.
    refractory_time : float,
        Duration of the refractory period, in second, Default is 1e-3.
    censored_time : float,
        Duration of the cesored period, in second. The min distance between two 
        spikes found with the spikesorter. Default is .5e-3


    Returns
    -------
    ratio_contamination : float
        Ratio of contamination.
